# Smart Loop-Pedal

I want a midi loop pedal. When I press it, it will listen to a pattern I play and then will start repeating it as soon as I release it.

- [ ] Potential problem: with long enough sequences that don't actually have any commonality, there could be quite a bit of overlap. How much of a problem is this? Test.
